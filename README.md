# What Is Recommendation System?
A recommendation system is a subclass of Information filtering Systems that seeks to predict the rating or the preference a user might give to an item. In simple words, it is an algorithm that suggests relevant items to users. 
Eg: In the case of Netflix which movie to watch, In the case of e-commerce which product to buy, or In the case of kindle which book to read, etc.

## Types of recommendation systems are as follows:

- Popularity based recommendation system
- Collaborative recommendation system
- Content-based recommendation system
- Demographic-based recommendation system
- Utility-based recommendation system
- Knowledge-based recommendation system
- Hybrid-recommendation system

## How does it work?
Recommendation systems collect customer data and auto analyze this data to generate customized recommendations for your customers. These systems rely on both implicit data such as browsing history and purchases and explicit data such as ratings provided by the user.

Content-based filtering and collaborative filtering are two approaches commonly used to generate recommendations. But we have some other recommendations approaches too.
Here in this project we use Collaborative recommendation system to recommend book to the user on the basic of other user preference.
