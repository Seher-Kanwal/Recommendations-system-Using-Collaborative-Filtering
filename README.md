# What Is Recommendation System?
A recommendation system is a subclass of Information filtering Systems that seeks to predict the rating or the preference a user might give to an item. In simple words, it is an algorithm that suggests relevant items to users. 
Eg: In the case of Netflix which movie to watch, In the case of e-commerce which product to buy, or In the case of kindle which book to read, etc.

## Types of recommendation systems are as follows:

- Popularity based recommendation system
- Collaborative recommendation system
- Content-based recommendation system
- Demographic-based recommendation system
- Utility-based recommendation system
- Knowledge-based recommendation system
- Hybrid-recommendation system

## How does it work?
Recommendation systems collect customer data and auto analyze this data to generate customized recommendations for your customers. These systems rely on both implicit data such as browsing history and purchases and explicit data such as ratings provided by the user.

Content-based filtering and collaborative filtering are two approaches commonly used to generate recommendations. But we have some other recommendations approaches too.
Here in this project we use Collaborative recommendation system to recommend book to the user on the basic of other user preference.

# Collaborative Filtering

The Collaborative filtering method for recommender systems is a method that is solely based on the past interactions that have been recorded between users and items, in order to produce new recommendations. Collaborative Filtering tends to find what similar users would like and the recommendations to be provided and in order to classify the users into clusters of similar types and recommend each user according to the preference of its cluster. The main idea that governs the collaborative methods is that through past user-item interactions when processed through the system, it becomes sufficient to detect similar users or similar items to make predictions based on these estimated facts and insights.
